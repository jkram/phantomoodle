Phantom Oodle

Phantom Oodle is a phantom husk of a real open source learning management system.

Phantom Oodle is not an application or a learning management system.

Phantom Oodle is inspired by "Moodleâ„¢ software" (see https://moodle.com/ ) 

This project's purpose is to provide a superficial "looks like Moodle, kind of" code base.
